<main>
    <p>Hi there! A little bit about me, My name is Sophia, and I’m currently a senior at Illinois State University, studying Creative Technology with a focus on photography and video editing. Over the years, I’ve developed a deep passion for visual storytelling—whether it’s capturing a single moment through photography or weaving together a narrative in a video. My work allows me to experiment with both the technical and artistic sides of media, and I love how technology can enhance creativity in ways I never imagined when I first started. Photography and video editing are more than just skills to me; they’re ways of expressing ideas, emotions, and stories that go beyond words. I enjoy the challenge of transforming a concept into a visual experience that resonates with others. As I approach graduation, I’m excited about applying what I’ve learned in the classroom to real-world projects, and I’m eager to explore opportunities in media production, content creation, and digital design. I’m looking forward to the future and where this creative journey will take me.</p>
